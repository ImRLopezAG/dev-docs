# Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Creational Patterns))
    Factory Method
      Creates objects without specifying exact class
      Delegates instantiation to subclasses
    Abstract Factory
      Creates families of related objects
      Ensures compatibility between products
    Builder
      Constructs complex objects step by step
      Separates construction from representation
    Prototype
      Clones existing objects
      Avoids expensive creation
    Singleton
      Ensures single instance
      Global access point
```

## Quick Comparison

| Pattern | Intent | Complexity | Frequency |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Factory Method | Defer instantiation to subclasses | ⭐⭐ | Very Common |
| Abstract Factory | Create families of objects | ⭐⭐⭐ | Common |
| Builder | Build complex objects step by step | ⭐⭐ | Common |
| Prototype | Clone objects | ⭐ | Less Common |
| Singleton | Single instance | ⭐ | Very Common |

## When to Use Which?

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Need to create objects?] --> B{How complex<br/>is the object?}
    
    B -->|Simple| C{Need flexibility<br/>in type?}
    B -->|Complex with<br/>many parts| D[Builder]
    B -->|Expensive to create| E[Prototype]
    
    C -->|Yes, one type| F[Factory Method]
    C -->|Yes, families| G[Abstract Factory]
    C -->|No, just one instance| H[Singleton]
