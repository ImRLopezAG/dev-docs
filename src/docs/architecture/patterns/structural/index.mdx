# Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Structural Patterns))
    Adapter
      Converts interface of a class
      Wraps incompatible objects
    Bridge
      Separates abstraction from implementation
      Allows independent variation
    Composite
      Composes objects into tree structures
      Treats individual and composite uniformly
    Decorator
      Adds responsibilities dynamically
      Wraps objects to extend behavior
    Facade
      Provides simplified interface
      Hides system complexity
    Flyweight
      Shares common state
      Reduces memory usage
    Proxy
      Controls access to object
      Provides placeholder
```

## Quick Comparison

| Pattern | Intent | Complexity | Frequency |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Adapter | Make incompatible interfaces work together | ⭐⭐ | Very Common |
| Bridge | Separate abstraction from implementation | ⭐⭐⭐ | Common |
| Composite | Compose objects into trees | ⭐⭐ | Common |
| Decorator | Add responsibilities dynamically | ⭐⭐ | Common |
| Facade | Simplify complex subsystems | ⭐ | Very Common |
| Flyweight | Share common state efficiently | ⭐⭐⭐ | Less Common |
| Proxy | Control access to objects | ⭐⭐ | Common |
